🚀 Employee Management System using Python (Tkinter) and SQL 💻

Excited to share my latest project! 🎉

I've developed a comprehensive Employee Management System that streamlines HR operations through an intuitive interface and powerful backend using Python (Tkinter) and SQL.

✨ Key Features:

🔐 Admin Login: Secure access to the system.
📝 CRUD Operations: Easily Add, Update, Delete, and Search employees.
🔎 Search Functionality: Search employees by ID, Name, Phone No., Role, Gender, and Salary.
🧹 Bulk Actions: Delete all records with a single click.
💡 This project has helped me dive deeper into Python GUI development, and SQL database management, while focusing on user-friendly interfaces and data integrity.
